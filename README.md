# Trinkets Mod for Minecraft 1.21.6

I was trying features about Fabric and Minecraft modding, and I decided to do a Mod about "Trinkets", items with different purposes.

This was made from this basic [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) repository.

## Features (06-07-2025)

- Creation of an item and making it a fuel (testing)
- Basic registry for items, item group "Trinkets" in creative inventory
- Trinket slots 9-10 colored with light red
- Dynamic lights using mod created by LambdAurora

## List of Trinkets

- Candle: Just 1 tier for now, emits 15 light level when hold in slots 9-10.

## Requirements for develelopment

- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- [LambDynamicLights by LambdAurora](https://lambdaurora.dev/projects/lambdynamiclights/docs/v4/)
- Minecraft version matching the Fabric Loader

*Some of should already work by using build.gradle in project*  
I have installed the **Minecraft Development** plugin for IntelliJ to simplify development in general

If you found any problems, consider checking documentation:
- [Yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn/tree/1.21.7)
- [Loom](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom)
- [Develop](https://fabricmc.net/develop/) for maintenance

## Considerations

I am learning so refactoring ideas for simplifying code or repair any bugs encountered is highly appreciated!
