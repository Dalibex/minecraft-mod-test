# Minecraft Mod for Testing

I am currently trying features about Fabric and Minecraft modding.  
This repository is mainly for learning purposes and testing how the Fabric ecosystem works, at least for now.

It contains several example items taken and adapted from the official Fabric documentation.  
Additionally, it has the correct folder structure and subdirectories set up for a functional mod.  

Feel free to use this as a more advanced starting point compared to the basic [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) repository.  
Anyone is welcome to fork, clone, or use this as a base for their own projects.

## Features (29-06-2025)

- Creation of an item and making it a fuel
- Basic registry examples for items and item groups
- Clean and correct folder structure for Fabric mods

## Requirements

- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)  
- Minecraft version matching the Fabric Loader

I have installed the **Minecraft Development** plugin for IntelliJ to simplify development in general but it is not necessary
